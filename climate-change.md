^ Today, as a dad. The current trend of climate change is not looking great
^ Tough talk but let's make it hopeful and positive. 
^ We'll be looking at the developer side of things. Wat we can do. But mostly, what we can do as humans
^ maybe obvious, im sorry. No blaming, I promise

* ⚠️ I'm not a climate scientist :)
* 👏 let's do it positively
* 👉 No pointing fingers

# Let's look into the situation before diving further

^ We humans are creating many problems (biodiversity, soil pollution, ...) but the main one is CO2 emissions because it has a massive impact on climate.

 **48%** of world total global emissions since I was born

# My footprint in 2018

* Me : **17.4 Tons / year**
* NL : 10.8 Tons / year
* Global : 5.1 Tons / year
* **Goal : 3 Tons / year**

* Tech represents **only 1/5** of my emissions
* Over half is me travelling
* A trip to San Fransisco = roughly **2 Tons** of CO2

We are not **perfect**. We get better every day

But we do need to be passionate

We can compensate for what we can't reduce.

If we are not the change, who is ?

> **The richest 10%** of the global population, are responsible for about **52% of global emissions ...**

"We are just 1% of emissions".
