^ Today, as a dad. The current trend of climate change is not looking great
^ Tough talk but let's make it hopeful and positive. 
^ We'll be looking at the developer side of things. Wat we can do. But mostly, what we can do as humans
^ maybe obvious, im sorry. No blaming, I promise

* ⚠️ I'm not a climate scientist :)
* 👏 let's do it positively
* 👉 No pointing fingers

^ We humans are creating many problems (biodiversity, soil pollution, ...) but the main one is CO2 emissions because it has a massive impact on climate.

* **48%** of world total global emissions since I was born

Global "warming" is a bad term.

80% of the cost is in the production of devices. Let's make sure NOT to need to change devices.

To wish the change, you have to _be_ the change.

We need to act now, on all fronts

if you are not the change, who is money

no guilt shaming, we are not perfect. No zealots

We are just 1%. Yes, but.

It's the corporations. True. But we have 2 choices: 

* Reduce consumption
* Vote! 
* Don't work there.

Life is fun out of tech!

It's really not too late, at your level.

REDUCE 
REUSE 
RECYCLE

What to do tomorrow : 

* Yourself first, others second
* Reduce, reduce, reduce, 
* Spread the word

We are all well aware of it : the current trend of climate change is not looking great. We can already feel some of its consequences and it is very likely to only become worse.
Tech is driving the world though, and us developers can surely help make an impact to bend the curve. So let's dive into the topic together and see how we can debug it!

In this talk, we will look into the current situation, globally but also in the tech space. We will dive into the impact that we can make on our applications as developers.
We will start by talking about our technical stack and what we can do to improve it, from reactive architectures to web performance. We will run the numbers and see the kind of improvements we can reach there.
But we will also look into the larger perspective of things, and look closer at our own personal footprint.

The future may look uncertain, but we can all start making a difference today and look at things in a positive way. So let's debug!

At the end of this talk, attendees will :

* Know more about the impact of IT on climate change, in a factual way
* Learn about specific technologies and tools that can make an impact on their applications in terms of energy consumption
* Have clear and specific action items to reduce their footprint, and further
